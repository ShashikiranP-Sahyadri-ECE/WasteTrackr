Build a full-stack lightweight digital record-keeping and reporting system for a semi-mechanized Material Recovery Facility (MRF) to track waste loads.

Requirements:

1. Backend: Python Flask API
   - Expose endpoints to add waste load records
   - Store data in a local SQLite database (or CSV)
   - Endpoint to fetch all records
   - Generate weekly and monthly summary reports as CSV or PDF

2. Frontend: Responsive HTML + CSS + JavaScript interface
   - Waste Load Entry Form with fields:
       - Vehicle Number (text)
       - Date & Time (auto-filled but editable)
       - Waste Weight (kg, number)
       - Waste Type (dropdown: Mixed, Dry, Wet)
       - Material Category (dropdown: Plastic, Glass, Rubber, Multi-layered Packaging)
       - Destination (dropdown: Recycler, Landfill, Cement Factory)
   - Submit button sends data to Flask backend API
   - Show success or error messages on submit

3. Data Persistence:
   - Use SQLite database for storing records persistently
   - Implement offline-first functionality using browser localStorage
     * If offline, save data locally and sync automatically when back online

4. Reporting:
   - Web page `/reports` that displays:
     - A table of all records
     - Summary charts (bar/pie) for waste volume by category and destination using Chart.js or similar
   - Button to download weekly/monthly reports as CSV or PDF

5. Bonus:
   - Basic user authentication (optional)
   - Input validations on frontend and backend
   - Deployment instructions to run locally or on cloud (like Replit)

6. Style:
   - Use Bootstrap or simple CSS for responsive UI

Deliverables:
- Complete runnable Replit project with backend and frontend
- Well-structured code with comments
- README with setup and usage instructions
- Demo video or GIF is optional

Please generate the entire codebase including:

- `app.py` for Flask backend
- HTML templates for form and reports
- JavaScript for frontend logic, offline sync, and chart rendering
- CSS (if any)
- Database schema/init script
- Instructions to run the project

Make sure the app can be run easily in Replit environment and tested immediately.
